    <p>You'll love Phyllis's homemade baked mac & cheese. It begins with a stovetop cheese sauce stirred with elbow macaroni, and finishes in the oven with more Cheddar and seasoned breadcrumbs baked on top. There's also a version with sauteed shrimp that you really must try.</p>
    <h2>Ingredients:</h2>
    <ul>
        <il>4 tablespoons butter, divided</il>
        <il>2 cups whole milk, or as needed</il>
        <il>3 tablespoons all-purpose flour</il>
        <il>24 ounces extra-sharp yellow Cheddar cheese, cubed</il>
        <il>16 ounces sharp Cheddar cheese, cubed</il>
        <il>2 pounds elbow macaroni</il>
        <il>2 large eggs, beaten</il>
        <il>salt and freshly ground black pepper</il>
        <il>2 pounds shredded sharp Cheddar cheese</il>
        <il>1/2 cup seasoned breadcrumbs (optional)</il>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F. Grease a large casserole dish.</li>
        <li>Melt 2 tablespoons butter in a saucepan over medium heat. Add milk, bring to a simmer, then reduce heat to low. Mix flour with 2 to 3 tablespoons water until smooth.  Add flour mixture to the saucepan, stirring constantly, and cook until sauce thickens. Add cubed extra-sharp Cheddar and cubed sharp Cheddar cheese, stirring until cheese melts. Remove from heat.</li>
        <li>Meanwhile, bring a large pot of salted water to a boil, and cook elbow macaroni until al dente (tender with a bite), about 8 minutes, or according to package instructions. Drain and set aside. </li>
        <li>Melt remaining 2 tablespoons butter in a microwave-safe bowl on High, about 10 seconds. In a large bowl, combine elbow macaroni, melted  butter, and eggs. Stir in cheese sauce; adding a little more milk if the sauce seems too thick. Season with salt and pepper.  </li>
        <li>Pour macaroni and cheese into the prepared casserole dish. Top with shredded cheese and seasoned breadcrumbs.</li>
        <li>Bake in the preheated oven until golden-brown and bubbling, 35 to 45 minutes.</li>
    </ol>
